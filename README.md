#Lab Assignment 3
This project is a Node.js & Express.js application demonstrating basic API development, JSON data handling, and CRUD operations.
It includes three JavaScript files: 
one for displaying student names, 
second for serving JSON data, 
third for handling CRUD operations via Express.js. 
A sample JSON file is provided inside a "data" folder. The project is tested using Postman and follows best practices in API routing and development. 
To run the project, install dependencies with npm install, start the server with npm start, and access the API at http://localhost:3000/.
